## Setting up files.
To setup a new machine, either clone the repository and set the source of config
files to be the files included for every application, or link the files in this
repository to the application's default config location.

Default config locations:
- Fish: `~/.config/fish/`
- nvim: `~/.config/nvim/`
- bash: `~/`
